## 3. Analytics Queries (Kusto Query Language - KQL)
**Description:**  
Powerful query engine to analyze collected telemetry and extract actionable insights.

**Usefulness in Power Platform:**  
Enables custom reporting, root cause analysis, and trend identification for Power Platform apps and flows, such as error trends, user adoption, and performance bottlenecks.

---

## 4. Smart Alerts
**Description:**  
Customizable alerts based on thresholds or anomalies in telemetry data.

**Usefulness in Power Platform:**  
Automatically notifies admins or support teams if failures, performance issues, or suspicious behaviors are detected in Power Platform environments.
